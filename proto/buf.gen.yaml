# Proto code generation is handled by build.rs using tonic-prost-build.
# This file exists for future language targets (e.g., TypeScript SDK).
#
# Rust code generation:
# - Development: build.rs compiles protos at build time
# - crates.io: Pre-generated code in crates/raft/src/generated/ledger.v1.rs
#
# To update the pre-generated fallback file, copy the build output:
#   cargo build -p inferadb-ledger-raft
#   cp target/debug/build/inferadb-ledger-raft-*/out/ledger.v1.rs \
#      crates/raft/src/generated/
